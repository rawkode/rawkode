Rust ... slowly but surely, all applications are being rewritten in Rust.

My next few tips will cover a few of these :)

## Exa

[Exa](https://github.com/ogham/exa) is an `ls` replacement written in Rust. As they say in their `README`:

> with more features and better defaults

What does it look like?

Pretty shiny, eh?

Things worth noting:

1. Colours that distinguish directories, files, and executable files
2. Colours for permissions, owners, and size of file
3. Git status of each file in long output

### Trees Everywhere

When working with code, it can be pretty nice to get a `tree` style look at the repository. Exa surpasses expectations here too.

First, here are a few aliases I have configured:

```shell
# ls
TREE_IGNORE="cache|log|logs|node_modules|vendor"

alias ls=' exa --group-directories-first'
alias la=' ls -a'
alias ll=' ls --git -l'
alias lt=' ls --tree -D -L 2 -I ${TREE_IGNORE}'
alias ltt=' ls --tree -D -L 3 -I ${TREE_IGNORE}'
alias lttt=' ls --tree -D -L 4 -I ${TREE_IGNORE}'
alias ltttt=' ls --tree -D -L 5 -I ${TREE_IGNORE}'
```

Let me explain:

- `--tree` - Enables Tree display
- `-D` - Show directories only (Useful for large trees)
- `-L n` - How many levels deep to display
- `-I ${TREE_IGNORE}` - This omits/hides common vendor directories, as defined in the variable above the aliases


Here's a short `asciinema` of me using the `lt`, `ltt`, and `lttt` aliases:
