With [Tip 1](/read/tip-1-per-directory-zshell-history-iph), we looked at how we can switch our history between local directory and global.

Regardless of which you're using, some stuff just doesn't belong there; right?

Do you really use to <kbd>Control + r</kbd> or <kbd>Up</kbd> to find `ls`, `cd`, or `rm`?

No. The answer is no.

## Keeping History Clean

Here are 3 short and sweet options you can configure in your `zshrc` file to keep your history lean, mean, and clean.

### Forget Duplicate Commands

Zsh can de-duplicate your command history :smile:

Enable this behaviour with `setopt HIST_IGNORE_DUPS`

### Forget Common Commands

The next approach to keeping our history clean is using `HISTIGNORE`.

```shell
HISTIGNORE="&:ls:[bf]g:exit:reset:clear:cd:cd ..:cd..:zh"
```

This is a global list of commands and patterns that you don't want to keep.

Use this for all your trivial commands that don't warrant searching later.

### Forget Space Commands

Another great feature of Zsh is hiding commands preceding with a <kbd>Space</kbd>

Enable this behaviour with `setopt HIST_IGNORE_SPACE`


```shell
# Not stored in history
 ls

# Stored in history
ls
```
