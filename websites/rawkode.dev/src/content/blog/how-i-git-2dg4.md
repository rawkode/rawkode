I've been slinging code for nearly 20 years now. I've navigated the murky waters of version control, starting with CVS, Subversion, Perforce, and Git; with the latter being my de-facto since around 2010.

### Mild Rant About Git

Git isn't the version control system I want, but it is the version control system I have. I won't complain too much, but why does Git require an email address to identify authors and why can't a commit have multiple authors? Pfft.

I firmly believe that we're stuck with Git. The only company that can change that is GitHub; providing a newer better VCS that would allow interoperability with Git while we all migrate over.

Will that ever happen? Doubtful :disappointed:

### Cloning Repositories

First, we'll start with the simplest of concerns ...

#### Clone to Where?

I clone all my repositories to `~/Code/src`. This is also my `GOPATH`. For Go developers, this is likely unsurprising.

I used to keep my Go projects and other code in separate directories, but eventually this become quite natural to adopt the "Go way".

Inside of `~/Code/src` is a directory for every host that I clone repositories from. Inside their, orgs/usernames. Inside them, individual repositories.

It looks like this:

```
~/Code/src:

├── aur.archlinux.org
│  ├── fluxlang
│  ├── pulumi-bin
│  └── yay
├── github.com
│  ├── chaoss
│  │  └── augur
│  ├── influxdata
│  │  ├── flux
│  │  ├── influxdb
│  │  ├── telegraf
│  ├── pulumi
│  │  └── pulumi
│  ├── rawkode
│  │  ├── dotfiles
│  │  ├── influxdb-examples
│  │  ├── kubernetes-workshop
│  │  ├── modern-life
│  │  ├── php-stat-influxdb
│  │  └── saltstack-dotfiles
└── golang.org
   └── x
      ├── lint
      └── tools
```

#### The Actual Cloning

There are two rules when cloning repositories:

1. Clone Over HTTPs
2. Never clone a fork directly

#### Clone Over HTTPS

I'm a rather cautious person. I've got into the habit of only cloning public repositories over HTTPs so that I never accidentally push to master. Even if I don't own the repository, i've made this my default and it keeps me sane.

NB: This is a "whenever possible" rule. For private repositories, you will need to use ssh cloning; so always adopt the rule below too.

#### Never Clone a Fork Directly

If you fork a repository, always clone the origin first.

As an example. I have a fork of my companies primary product, InfluxDB.

I clone this with `git clone https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb`

I then add my fork as a remote with `git remote add rawkode git@github.com:rawkode/influxdb`

Now, when you've made your awesome changes to some OSS project; you push with `git push rawkode`. Simples! :tada:

##### Tip

GitHub has a cool CLI command called `hub` that allows you perform the above with `hub fork`

### Working with Git

Now that I've got lots of code available to work on, how do I work with it?

#### GPG Signing

I always ensure that I sign my commits with my GPG key. If you aren't comfortable provisioning your own GPG key, checkout [Keybase](https://keybase.io).

Very little is required to configure GPG signing. Some people specify their key in the config, but as I only have one secret key available locally, as you probably will too, it's not required.

```
[gpg]
  program = gpg
[commit]
  gpgsign = true
```

#### Commit Template

My Git commits are terrible. I've been using a template lately to remind myself when the commit screen pops up that I should do better.

```
[commit]
  template = ~/.git/templates/commit
```

I've got an old [template](https://github.com/rawkode/saltstack-dotfiles/blob/master/states/development/git/files/templates/commit.txt) that I've used for years, but more recently I've been trying to adopt [Semantic Commits](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages), such as:

```
feat: add hat wobble
^--^  ^------------^
|     |
|     +-> Summary in present tense.
|
+-------> Type: chore, docs, feat, fix, refactor, style, or test.
```

#### Default Editor

I use VSCode for all my editing now, even Git commits :smile:

```
[core]
  editor = code --wait
```

#### Aliases

Here are some of my favourite aliases.

##### Pull

I really like dislike merge commits. So much so, I always do a pull with a rebase to neatly, and cleanly, merge in missing changes; keeping my commits at the top.

```
[alias]
  pl = pull --rebase
```

##### Cane

Ever committed something and forgot to add a file? Ever committed a fix that wasn't actually the fix and then had to add a new commit with the actual fix? Yep. You need `git cane`.

This will add / stage changes and add them to your previous commit.

```
[alias]
  cane = commit --amend --no-edit
```

##### The Rest

These are all rather simple short cuts.

```
[alias]
  cm = commit -v
  co = checkout
  ps = push
  st = status
```
