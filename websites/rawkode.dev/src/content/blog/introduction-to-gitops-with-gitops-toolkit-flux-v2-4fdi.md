GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery.  It works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. With GitOps, the use of software agents can alert on any divergence between Git with what's running in a cluster, and if there's a difference, Kubernetes reconcilers automatically update or rollback the cluster depending on the case. With Git at the center of your delivery pipelines, developers use familiar tools to make pull requests to accelerate and simplify both application deployments and operations tasks to Kubernetes.

The GitOps Toolkit is a set of composable APIs and specialised tools that can be used to build a Continuous Delivery platform on top of Kubernetes.

These tools are build with Kubernetes controller-runtime libraries, and they can be dynamically configured with Kubernetes custom resources either by cluster admins or by other automated tools. The GitOps Toolkit components interact with each other via Kubernetes events and are responsible for the reconciliation of their designated API objects.
