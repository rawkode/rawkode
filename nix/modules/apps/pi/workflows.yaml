      plan:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are in planning mode. Focus on analysis and planning. Do not implement.
        instructions: |
          Create a concise numbered plan to accomplish the objective.
          Call out assumptions and gaps.
          End with: `Plan ready for build.`

        next: plan-review

      plan-review:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are running a council review gate. Gather independent reviews from
          subagents, synthesize their feedback, and emit a single verdict.
        instructions: |
          Use the subagent tool in parallel to get independent reviews of the plan:

          ```json
          {
            "tasks": [
              { "agent": "cosette", "task": "Review this plan for requirements fit, scope, and delivery risk. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "otis", "task": "Review this plan for engineering feasibility, architecture fit, and sequencing. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "cypress", "task": "Review this plan for quality risks, missing checks, and potential regressions. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "opal", "task": "Review this plan for design, API contracts, and performance risks. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "garnet", "task": "Review this plan for resilience, observability, and operational readiness risks. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "cricket", "task": "Review this plan for testability, coverage gaps, and validation risks. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" }
            ],
            "agentScope": "both",
            "confirmProjectAgents": false
          }
          ```

          Synthesize the council feedback. If all approve with no critical issues, emit:
          VERDICT: build

          If any agent raises critical concerns, emit:
          VERDICT: plan
        tools: [read, grep, find, ls, subagent]
        requireApproval: true
        verdicts:
          build: build
          plan: plan

      build:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are in execution mode. Implement minimal, correct changes. Verify incrementally.
        instructions: |
          Implement according to the approved plan and latest council feedback.
          Summarize key changes and any remaining risks.
        tools: [read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls]
        next: build-review

      build-review:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are running a council review gate. Gather independent reviews from
          subagents, synthesize their feedback, and emit a single verdict.
        instructions: |
          Use the subagent tool in parallel to review the implementation:

          ```json
          {
            "tasks": [
              { "agent": "otis", "task": "Review the implementation for correctness, architecture fit, and maintainability. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "cypress", "task": "Review the implementation for correctness, security, and resilience. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "opal", "task": "Review the implementation for design quality, performance, and API contracts. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "garnet", "task": "Review the implementation for resilience, observability, and operational readiness. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" }
            ],
            "agentScope": "both",
            "confirmProjectAgents": false
          }
          ```

          Synthesize the council feedback. If approved, emit:
          VERDICT: review

          If critical issues found, emit:
          VERDICT: build

          If the approach is fundamentally wrong, emit:
          VERDICT: plan
        tools: [read, grep, find, ls, subagent]
        verdicts:
          review: review
          build: build
          plan: plan

      review:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are in execution mode. Fix issues found during review.
        instructions: |
          Perform a self-review pass and fix issues found.
          Call out what was fixed and what remains.
        tools: [read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls]
        next: review-gate

      review-gate:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are running a council review gate. Gather independent reviews from
          subagents, synthesize their feedback, and emit a single verdict.
        instructions: |
          Use the subagent tool in parallel to review the self-review fixes:

          ```json
          {
            "tasks": [
              { "agent": "cypress", "task": "Review the latest changes for quality, correctness, and regressions. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "opal", "task": "Review the latest changes for design quality, performance, and regressions. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "garnet", "task": "Review the latest changes for resilience, observability, and regressions. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "cricket", "task": "Review the latest changes for testability and validation readiness. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" }
            ],
            "agentScope": "both",
            "confirmProjectAgents": false
          }
          ```

          Synthesize the council feedback. If approved, emit:
          VERDICT: test

          If issues found, emit:
          VERDICT: review

          If fundamentally wrong, emit:
          VERDICT: plan
        tools: [read, grep, find, ls, subagent]
        verdicts:
          test: test
          review: review
          plan: plan

      test:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are in execution mode. Run tests and fix failures.
        instructions: |
          Run relevant tests and validation commands.
          If failures occur, fix and rerun.
          Summarize verification evidence clearly.
        tools: [read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls]
        next: test-gate

      test-gate:
        systemPrompt: |
          You are running a council review gate. Gather independent reviews from
          subagents, synthesize their feedback, and emit a single verdict.
        instructions: |
          Use the subagent tool in parallel to review test evidence:

          ```json
          {
            "tasks": [
              { "agent": "cricket", "task": "Review test evidence for coverage depth and release confidence. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "oslo", "task": "Review test evidence for edge case coverage and defect prevention. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "gideon", "task": "Review test evidence for integration completeness and deployment readiness. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" },
              { "agent": "cosette", "task": "Review test evidence against the original objective and acceptance criteria. End with: VERDICT: APPROVE or VERDICT: REWORK" }
            ],
            "agentScope": "both",
            "confirmProjectAgents": false
          }
          ```

          Synthesize the council feedback. If quality bar is met, emit:
          VERDICT: done

          If more testing needed, emit:
          VERDICT: test

          If implementation issues found, emit:
          VERDICT: build
        tools: [read, grep, find, ls, subagent]
        verdicts:
          done: null
          test: test
          build: build
