# Let's Set The Scene

Why do we even need to discuss Cloud Native?

1. Monolith
2. SoA
3. Monolith
4. Containers
5. Microservices
6. Kubernetes
7. This is still hard

<hr style="margin: 2em;"/>

This is the order which most organisations **should** go

---

# Unfortunately ...

1. Monolith
2. Kubernetes
3. Containers
4. Microservices
5. Pain

# Some People Even Skip The Monolith!

---

# Skipping The Monolith Can Be Ok

## Challenges

1. Design is hard
2. Domain's aren't well understood in green field projects
3. Event driven system knowledge isn't within every organization
4. Decision fatigue

# Why Is This Hard?

Fallacies of Distributed Computing

- The network is reliable
- Latency is zero
- Bandwidth is infinite
- The network is secure
- Topology doesn't change
- There is one administrator
- Transport cost is zero
- The network is homogeneous

---

# Naive Implementations

- When was the last time your application had network error handling or retry logic?
  - Do you have multi-service transactions?
    - Europe infrastructure can be solid, what about the rest of the world?
- All users are in Europe, because we are
  - Do you monitor your applications / API latency from Australia?
- All users have fast internet
  - Do you compress or use binary format messaging, or JSON?
- Private networks are secure
  - Do your internal services run over TLS?
- Like networks, services aren't homogenous
  - Identify invariants, accommodate variants

---

# Micro-Services Give Us That For "Free"

"Free as in beer", hangover guaranteed

As we've adopted containers and removed the need for VMs, providing a lighter weight alternative that can be spun up sub-second; we've opened the door to them being used by default and at scale.

One of the promises of micro-services is that they allow us to write very small, trivial, applications.

"Just write a function" or "two pizza team" are common phrases used to describe the size of a micro-service.

Sadly, the devil lies in the details.

# Should This Be A Service?

ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è All Services Should Be Functions, Not All Functions Should Be Services

```js
// npm: is-even:1.0.0
if (i % 2 == 0) {
   return true;
}
return false;
```

---

# Maybe Not Ideal

---

# But, In-Case You Were Wondering ...

üòä

`is-odd` doesn't depend on `is-even`, but it does depend on `is-number`

```js

// is-odd:2.0.0
var isNumber = require('is-number');

module.exports = function isOdd(i) {
   if (!isNumber(i)) {
       throw new TypeError('is-odd expects a number.');
   }
   if (Number(i) !== Math.floor(i)) {
       throw new RangeError('is-odd expects an integer.');
   }
   return !!(~~i & 1);
};
```

# Where's the Complexity?

Infrastructure

As we spin up more micro-services, functions (potentially), we rely on a lot of infrastructure and convention to support them and make them feasible.

- Configuration
- Service discovery
- Secrets management
- Network fragility
- Logging
- Authentication
- Authorization

# 12 Factor

---
layout: section
---

# Rule 3

Store config in the environment

---
layout: section
---

# Rule 4

Treat backing services as attached resources

---
layout: section
---

# Rule 5

Strictly separate ~~~build~~~ CI and ~~~run~~~ CD stages

---
layout: section
---

# Rule 10

Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

---
layout: section
---

# Automation

---
layout: header-two-cols
---

# Automation Is Mandatory

::left::

- Environment Parity
- Continuous Integration
- Automated Tests
- Continuous Deployment

::right::

- Automation gives us **TRUST**
- Automation is the **FOUNDATION** on which we built

---
layout: section

# So ... What Do We Automate?

---

# All The Things!

---

# Table Stakes

Goal: **TRUST**

There should be no manual steps after a commit hits your `main` branch for it to get to production<sup>1</sup>.

This should happen many times a day.

Machines don't make mistakes<sup>1</sup>, people do.

<sub>1. Except "Those" Circumstances</sub>

---

# Continuous Deployment

Please Don't

We see this everywhere, from Kustomize, to Helm, to Terraform, and to every other deployment tool.

```shell

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ base
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ kubernetes-for-developers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ environments
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ production
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ staging
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ preprod
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ qa
```

**See 12-Factor rules** 3 and 10
- 03: Store config in the environment
- 10: Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

# GitOps

Well, Kinda.

GitOps is a way of managing your infrastructure and applications by using Git as a single source of truth. GitOps runs an operator in your cluster that watches a Git repository for changes to the desired state of your cluster. When a change is detected, the operator will make the necessary changes to your cluster to ensure that the actual state matches the desired state.

<hr class="m-8" />

## My Advice

Use Pulumi and Flux together. This also supports the mono-repo pattern.

## Distributed Systems Are Hard

As we remove the complexity from the application teams, it doesn't' disappear. It gets pushed down to the infrastructure.

# Service Mesh

Just use Linkerd üòä

Kubernetes services do provide:

- Name based discovery
- Simple load balancing

But a service mesh enriches:

- Automatic Timeouts & Retries
- mTLS
- Traffic Shaping / Advanced load balancing
- Canaries
- Circuit Breaking
- Fault Injection

# Contracts & Shared Dependencies

# Adopt a MonoRepo

Strange thing to be opininated on?

## ü§∑üèª

- Most distributed systems aren't homogeneous
- Protobufs are a good contract layer, even without gRPC
- Why package and version everything? It's **hard**.

## There's a reason Google, Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, etc do this.

# Let's Talk About Your APIs

Is OpenAPI Good Enough?

Now We Can Share Code/Components/Contracts, is OpenAPI our best option?

1. gRPC
2. GraphQL

---
layout: section
---

# Which?

---

# CQRS

Command Query Responsibility Separation

- gRPC is perfect for Commands (It's kinda in the name)
- GraphQL is perfect for Queries

<hr class="m-8" />

## This works because it aligns well with the domains

<div class="mt-8" />

- Commands have their logic in the Command service
- Queries have their logic in the consuming service

# But I Wanna!

# Telepresence

Telepresence is a tool that allows you to run a service locally and connect it to a remote Kubernetes cluster.

## It's Different

It turns a file system problem into a networking problem, and that is actually solvable.

- `telepresence connect` makes Kubernetes services available locally
- `telepresence intercept service-name` makes cluster traffic hit your machine
