# Letting Strangers Destroy My Clusters

## Abstract

Automating and securing your infrastructure is no easy task, but what if the entire point of the infrastructure was to allow strangers to destroy it?

In this session, I'll walk through how I automated the provisioning of bare metal Kubernetes clusters with the sole intent of giving access, as securely as I can, to strangers on the internet.

Let's have some fun.
