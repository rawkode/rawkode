== Why are we here?

=== Comtrya

I started working on Comtrya around 2020, it was my first real Rust project.

I reached out to a friend of mine that is a fantastic Rust developer and asked for some advice on implementing output.

`cargo add tracing`

[quote, "@rawkode"]
I mean for CLI output, not machine

=== !

[quote, "@a_hoverbear"]
Yes

😵‍💫

=== Fast-Forward, 2023

It's far from the best Rust advice Ana has ever given me, as they've given me A LOT.

=== But ...

It's some of the most *valuable* because it led me to instrumenting my Rust projects more than I ever would have normally.

[.important]
=== It's Easy

[.important]
=== Like Really Easy!

=== I Google'd

=== !

I couldn't find a single article or example of integrating into an application that didn't use a network protocol.

=== !

So I did what any sane person would do ...

[quote, "ChatGPT"]
As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, OpenTelemetry was primarily focused on instrumenting distributed systems, microservices, and cloud-native applications. However, it is possible to use OpenTelemetry to instrument command-line applications as well, although this use case might not be as well-documented or as commonly discussed ...

== So, What's the Plan?

== OpenTelemetry for Command Line Applications

Why should you use OpenTelemetry for a command line application?

=== Tricky

That's a hard question to answer, in all honesty.

Profiling applications has been notoriously difficult for a long, long, time.

=== eBPF & Parca

With eBPF and Parca, this is getting easier; but there may still be benefits to instrumenting your application.

=== !

- You can't profile your applications when it's running on someone else's machine
- Your users, customers, and colleagues can share the logs with you on tickets / issues
- You need log output anyway, what if you can achieve both without extra effort?
