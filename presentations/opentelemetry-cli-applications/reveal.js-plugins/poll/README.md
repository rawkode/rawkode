# Poll plugin

The poll plugin provides the capability to include instant polling within presentations using the [`seminar` plugin](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/seminar).

## Demo

A demo of the plugin is provided at <https://rajgoel.github.io/reveal.js-demos/seminar-demo.html>. In the demo anyone can open a seminar room to become a host and share a link with the room name to anyone else. Everyone with the link can follow the hosted presentation and take part in the poll. To participate in a poll the client must be connected to an open seminar room, otherwise the vote will be ignored. When connected to a room, the vote will be sent to the host and the aggregated results are sent to all participants. The client presentations will be automatically update with new votes by other participants.
