# Questions plugin

The questions plugin provides the capability to collect questions from the audience for a Q&A session. It uses the [`seminar` plugin](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-plugins/tree/master/seminar).

## Demo

A demo of the plugin is provided at <https://rajgoel.github.io/reveal.js-demos/seminar-demo.html>. In the demo anyone can open a seminar room to become a host and share a link with the room name to anyone else. Everyone with the link can follow the hosted presentation ask questions. Other participants can upvote questions and hosts can close questions.


You may want to take a look at the [source code](https://github.com/rajgoel/reveal.js-demos) of the demo presentation.
